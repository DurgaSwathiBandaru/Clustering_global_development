Clustered countries based on development indicators using K-Means to uncover global development patterns.
# Country Clustering using K-Means (Global Development)

This project applies K-Means clustering to group countries based on development indicators such as GDP, health, and education levels. The goal is to uncover clusters of countries with similar socio-economic profiles for global analysis and policy-making.

##  Problem Statement
To segment countries into development-based groups using unsupervised learning on multiple real-world indicators.

---

##  Approach
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed missing/null values and standardized features.
- **Feature Selection**: Chose meaningful indicators like GDP, literacy rate, life expectancy, population.
- **Clustering**: Applied the K-Means algorithm.
- **Evaluation**: Used Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **Visualization**: Plotted cluster assignments using scatter plots and dimensionality reduction (PCA).

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Plotly (optional for map-based visuals) same as it is is that ok
